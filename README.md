# Face-Mask-Object-Detection-With-CNN-Boosting-PCA
Face mask and temperature detection with Raspberry Pi

In this repository I propose a simple solution to lower the spread of the virus by checking that people are wearing their mask and also their temperature before they enter a crowded or enclosed place.

# Few different solutions were tested:
1. Deep learning: Transfer learning (MobileNetV2 / NASNetLarge)
2. Boosting: Adaboost / GAB / Gradient Boost / RAB
3. Classic ML: PCA / KNN / RF (random forest), SVC
